# ðŸš€ Quick Setup - Cloud Sync

## Step 1: Apply Database Migration

Run this command to create the database tables:

```bash
# If using Supabase CLI locally
supabase db push

# Or apply the migration file directly in Supabase Dashboard
# Go to SQL Editor and run the migration file:
# supabase/migrations/20251029120000_create_cloud_sync_tables.sql
```

## Step 2: Verify Setup

1. Open Supabase Dashboard
2. Go to **Table Editor**
3. You should see these new tables:
   - âœ… `tasks`
   - âœ… `categories`
   - âœ… `user_analytics`

4. Go to **Authentication** â†’ **Policies**
5. Verify RLS policies are enabled for all tables

## Step 3: Test It!

### Test on Single Device
1. **Login** to your app
2. **Create a task** (e.g., "Test cloud sync")
3. **Open Supabase Dashboard** â†’ Table Editor â†’ tasks
4. **Verify** the task appears in the database
5. âœ… Success! Cloud sync is working

### Test Multi-Device Sync
1. **Open app on Device 1** (e.g., laptop browser)
2. **Open app on Device 2** (e.g., phone or another browser)
3. **Login with same account** on both devices
4. **Create a task on Device 1**
5. **Watch it appear on Device 2** (within 1-2 seconds)
6. **Complete the task on Device 2**
7. **Watch it update on Device 1**
8. âœ… Success! Real-time sync is working

### Test Offline Mode
1. **Turn off WiFi/Internet**
2. **Create some tasks** in the app
3. **Notice** "Offline mode" indicator appears
4. **Turn WiFi back on**
5. **Notice** "Synced to cloud" message appears
6. **Check Supabase Dashboard** â†’ tasks should be there
7. âœ… Success! Offline sync is working

## Step 4: Migrate Existing Users

If you have existing users with localStorage data:

1. **They login** to the app
2. **Migration runs automatically** (one-time)
3. **All their local data** moves to cloud
4. **They see** "Data synced from cloud" message
5. âœ… Done! No action needed from users

## What Users Will Experience

### New Users
- Sign up â†’ Get default categories â†’ Start using app
- Everything automatically saves to cloud
- Can login from any device

### Existing Users
- Login â†’ See "Data synced from cloud" message
- All their tasks and categories are preserved
- Can now access from any device

## Environment Variables

Make sure these are set in your `.env` file:

```env
VITE_SUPABASE_URL=your_supabase_url
VITE_SUPABASE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=your_supabase_anon_key
```

## Troubleshooting
