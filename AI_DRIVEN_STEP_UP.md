# AI-Driven Step Up System

## Overview
The Step Up system is now **fully AI-driven** with no fixed criteria. The AI analyzes complete task history and makes intelligent decisions about when users are ready to level up.

---

## üß† How It Works

### 1. Complete Data Analysis
The AI receives **ALL** task data:
- ‚úÖ Complete completion history (all days, not just last 7)
- ‚úÖ All previous step-ups with dates
- ‚úÖ User profile (target exam, goals, name)
- ‚úÖ Task notes and category
- ‚úÖ Current progress and streaks
- ‚úÖ Task creation date

### 2. AI Decision Making
**No fixed rules!** The AI considers:
- Completion patterns and trends
- Recent performance (improving or declining?)
- Success of previous step-ups
- Task type and difficulty
- User's personal goals
- Psychological readiness
- Optimal timing

### 3. Adaptive Suggestions
The AI adapts based on:
- **First step-up**: More conservative, builds confidence
- **Multiple step-ups**: Considers progression rate
- **Long history**: Analyzes long-term patterns
- **Recent changes**: Responds to improvements

## üîÑ Data Flow

```
User completes tasks daily
        ‚Üì
Complete history tracked
        ‚Üì
Every 3 hours: Check eligible tasks
        ‚Üì
Send COMPLETE data to AI:
  - All completion history
  - All step-up history
  - User profile
  - Task details
        ‚Üì
AI analyzes everything
        ‚Üì
AI decides: Ready or Not Ready
        ‚Üì
If ready: Suggestion appears
        ‚Üì
User accepts ‚Üí History updated
        ‚Üì
Next analysis includes this step-up
```

## üìä Example Scenarios

### Scenario 1: First Step-Up (New User)
```
Task: Read 20 pages
History: 5 days, 80% completion
Step-ups: None

AI Analysis:
"User is new but showing consistency. Let's be conservative 
and suggest 22 pages (10% increase) to build confidence."

Decision: ‚úÖ Step up to 22 pages
Confidence: 75%
```

### Scenario 2: Multiple Step-Ups (Experienced)
```
Task: Read pages
History: 30 days, 90% completion
Step-ups: 
  - Day 7: 20 ‚Üí 25 pages
  - Day 14: 25 ‚Üí 30 pages
  - Day 21: 30 ‚Üí 35 pages

AI Analysis:
"User has successfully completed 3 step-ups with excellent 
consistency. They're ready for another 5-page increase."

Decision: ‚úÖ Step up to 40 pages
Confidence: 95%
```

### Scenario 3: Declining Performance
```
Task: Exercise 30 minutes
History: 20 days, recent 50% completion
Step-ups: 
  - Day 10: 20 ‚Üí 30 minutes

AI Analysis:
"User stepped up 10 days ago but completion rate dropped 
from 85% to 50%. They need time to adjust. Not ready yet."

Decision: ‚ùå Wait for improvement
Confidence: 90%
```

### Scenario 4: Long Consistent History
```
Task: Study 60 minutes
History: 45 days, 95% completion
Step-ups:
  - Day 10: 30 ‚Üí 40 minutes
  - Day 20: 40 ‚Üí 50 minutes
  - Day 30: 50 ‚Üí 60 minutes

AI Analysis:
"Exceptional consistency over 45 days with successful 
progressive increases. Ready for 70 minutes."

Decision: ‚úÖ Step up to 70 minutes
Confidence: 98%
```

## ü§ñ AI Models & Fallback

### Primary Model
**Gemini 2.0 Flash Exp** (Latest, fastest, free)
- Best performance
- Fastest response
- Free tier: 1,500 requests/day

### Fallback Models
If primary fails, automatically tries:
1. **Gemini 1.5 Flash** (Fast, reliable)
2. **Gemini 1.5 Pro** (Most capable, slower)

### Error Handling
```
Try Gemini 2.0 Flash Exp
  ‚Üì (if rate limit or error)
Wait 2 seconds
  ‚Üì
Try Gemini 1.5 Flash
  ‚Üì (if rate limit or error)
Wait 4 seconds (exponential backoff)
  ‚Üì
Try Gemini 1.5 Pro
  ‚Üì (if still fails)
Retry up to 3 times with exponential backoff
  ‚Üì
Return error (graceful failure)
```

---

## üõ°Ô∏è Robust Error Handling

### Rate Limit Handling
```typescript
// Automatic model switching
if (response.status === 429) {
  console.log('Rate limit hit, switching to fallback model');
  return callGeminiWithRetry(apiKey, prompt, nextModel, 0);
}
```

### Exponential Backoff
```typescript
// Retry delays: 2s, 4s, 8s
const delay = RETRY_DELAY_MS * Math.pow(2, retryCount);
await sleep(delay);
```

### Multiple Retry Attempts
- **3 retries** per model
- **3 models** to try
- **Total: 9 attempts** before giving up

### Graceful Failure
```typescript
// If all retries fail
return {
  shouldStepUp: false,
  suggestion: null,
  error: 'Service temporarily unavailable'
}
```
