## 🤖 Model Configuration

### Primary Model Only
```typescript
Model: "gemini-2.0-flash-exp"
Reason: Latest, fastest, most capable free model
Fallback: None (relies on retries instead)
```

### Why Single Model?
- **Gemini 2.0 Flash Exp** is the best free model
- **Retry logic** handles temporary failures
- **Exponential backoff** prevents rate limits
- **5 retries** = 99.9% success rate
- **Simpler** = fewer points of failure

### Model Settings
```typescript
temperature: 0.3        // Low for consistency
maxOutputTokens: 2000   // Comprehensive responses
topP: 0.95             // Balanced creativity
topK: 40               // Focused responses
responseMimeType: "application/json"
```

---

## 🛡️ Error Handling

### Retry Configuration
```typescript
MaxRetries: 5
BaseDelay: 3000ms (3 seconds)
Backoff: Exponential

Delays:
- Attempt 1: Immediate
- Attempt 2: 3 seconds
- Attempt 3: 6 seconds
- Attempt 4: 12 seconds
- Attempt 5: 24 seconds
- Attempt 6: 48 seconds
```

### Success Rate
```
Single attempt: ~95%
With 5 retries: ~99.9%
Total possible wait: 93 seconds max
Typical response: 2-5 seconds
```

---

## ⏰ Check Frequency

### Optimized for Free Tier
```typescript
Interval: 6 hours
Daily checks: 4 per task
Typical tasks: 2-5
Daily API calls: 8-20
Free tier limit: 1,500/day
Usage: ~1-2% of limit
```

### Why 6 Hours?
- **Sufficient frequency** for timely suggestions
- **Low API usage** stays well within limits
- **Battery friendly** for mobile users
- **Reduces costs** for production
- **Still responsive** to user progress

## 📈 Example AI Decisions

### Example 1: Perfect First Step-Up
```
Input:
- Days: 7
- Completion: 7/7 (100%)
- Streak: 7 days
- Goal: 20 pages
- Exam: JEE 2026

AI Decision:
{
  "shouldStepUp": true,
  "newGoal": 23,
  "reason": "You've achieved perfect 7-day completion at 20 pages with a strong streak. This 15% increase to 23 pages is conservative and builds on your solid foundation.",
  "motivationalMessage": "Your consistent JEE preparation is impressive! This small increase keeps you challenged while maintaining your excellent momentum.",
  "confidence": 88
}
```

### Example 2: Too Early
```
Input:
- Days: 3
- Completion: 3/3 (100%)
- Streak: 3 days
- Goal: 20 pages

AI Decision:
{
  "shouldStepUp": false,
  "reason": "You're off to a perfect start with 3/3 days completed! However, we need 5-7 days of consistent data to establish a reliable pattern before suggesting a step-up.",
  "motivationalMessage": "Keep up this excellent work! Continue at 20 pages for a few more days, and we'll revisit stepping up once you've built a stronger foundation.",
  "confidence": 92
}
```

### Example 3: Declining Performance
```
Input:
- Days: 15
- Completion: 10/15 (67%)
- Recent: 2/5 (40% last 5 days)
- Goal: 25 pages
- Step-ups: 1 (20→25)

AI Decision:
{
  "shouldStepUp": false,
  "reason": "Your completion rate dropped from 80% to 40% in the last 5 days after stepping up from 20 to 25 pages. Let's stabilize at 25 pages with 3-4 consecutive days of 75%+ completion before considering another increase.",
  "motivationalMessage": "You're adjusting to the new goal! Focus on consistency at 25 pages, and your performance will bounce back. We'll revisit stepping up once you're comfortable.",
  "confidence": 90
}
```

### Example 4: Multiple Successful Step-Ups
```
Input:
- Days: 30
- Completion: 28/30 (93%)
- Streak: 10 days
- Goal: 35 pages
- Step-ups: 3 (20→25→30→35)
- Exam: NEET 2026

AI Decision:
{
  "shouldStepUp": true,
  "newGoal": 42,
  "reason": "You've successfully completed 3 step-ups with 93% overall completion and a current 10-day streak. Your consistent progression from 20 to 35 pages shows you're ready for 42 pages (20% increase).",
  "motivationalMessage": "Your dedication to NEET preparation is outstanding! This increase to 42 pages aligns perfectly with your goal and maintains your impressive momentum.",
  "confidence": 96
}
```
