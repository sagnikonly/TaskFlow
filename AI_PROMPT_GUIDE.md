## 🧠 Analysis Framework

### 1. Pattern Recognition
AI must analyze:
- **Day-by-day trends**: Improving, stable, or declining?
- **Consistency**: How reliable is the user?
- **Patterns**: Specific days they struggle?
- **Recent vs. historical**: Any changes?
- **Gaps and breaks**: Recovery periods?

### 2. Readiness Assessment
AI must evaluate:
- **True readiness**: Not just numbers, but psychological state
- **Sustained consistency**: Not just a lucky streak
- **Comfort level**: Struggling or comfortable?
- **Momentum**: Building up or barely keeping up?
- **Impact**: Will step-up motivate or overwhelm?

### 3. Timing Evaluation
AI must consider:
- **Optimal moment**: Is NOW the right time?
- **Time at level**: Enough practice at current goal?
- **Trend direction**: Upward or downward?
- **Streak status**: Strong or recovering?
- **Cooldown**: Respected 3-day minimum?

### 4. Progression Rate
AI must calculate:
- **First step-up**: 10-15% max (conservative)
- **Second step-up**: 15-20% (moderate)
- **Third+ step-up**: 15-25% (progressive)
- **Previous success**: Continue pattern or adjust?
- **Never exceed**: 25% increase maximum
- **Always round**: Whole numbers only

### 5. Risk Assessment
AI must evaluate:
- **Demotivation risk**: Could this discourage?
- **Burnout risk**: Too much too soon?
- **Foundation strength**: Solid or shaky?
- **Struggle signs**: Any indicators of difficulty?
- **Confidence impact**: Failure would damage?

### 6. Contextual Factors
AI must consider:
- **Exam timeline**: Urgency of preparation
- **Task type**: Reading vs. exercise vs. study
- **User notes**: Any stress indicators?
- **Category**: Some allow faster progression
- **Overall goal**: How this task fits

## ⚠️ Critical Decision Rules

### DO NOT Suggest Step-Up If:
```
❌ Less than 3 days of history
   → Too early to establish pattern

❌ Completion rate below 60%
   → Struggling at current level

❌ Recent declining trend (last 3-5 days)
   → Performance getting worse

❌ Just recovered from break
   → Need stability first

❌ Previous step-up caused drop
   → Last increase was too much

❌ Current streak less than 3 days
   → Not stable yet

❌ User notes indicate difficulty
   → Explicit struggle mentioned
```

### Consider Step-Up If:
```
✅ At least 5-7 days solid history
   → Enough data to judge

✅ Completion rate 75%+ consistently
   → Comfortable at current level

✅ Current streak of 5+ days
   → Strong momentum

✅ Recent trend stable or improving
   → Performance maintaining or growing

✅ Previous step-ups successful
   → Can handle increases

✅ Comfortably hitting goal
   → Not struggling

✅ No signs of stress
   → Positive indicators
```

## 🎯 Step-Up Amount Guidelines

### First Step-Up (Conservative)
```
Increase: 10-15%
Reason: Building confidence
Example: 20 → 22 or 23 pages
```

### Second Step-Up (Moderate)
```
Increase: 15-20%
Reason: Proven capability
Example: 23 → 27 or 28 pages
```

### Third+ Step-Up (Progressive)
```
Increase: 15-25%
Reason: Established pattern
Example: 28 → 33 to 35 pages
```

### Rules:
- **Always whole numbers** (no decimals)
- **Never less than +1** from current
- **Never more than +25%** increase
- **Round sensibly** (prefer 5s and 0s)

## 📝 Response Requirements

### If Ready for Step-Up
```json
{
  "shouldStepUp": true,
  "newGoal": 35,  // Calculated using guidelines
  "reason": "You've maintained 90% completion over 15 days with a current 7-day streak. Your first step-up from 30 to 35 pages (17% increase) was successful, and you're consistently hitting your goal with room to grow.",
  "motivationalMessage": "Your dedication to JEE preparation is impressive! This increase to 40 pages aligns perfectly with your goal of scoring 250+ marks.",
  "confidence": 92
}
```

### If Not Ready
```json
{
  "shouldStepUp": false,
  "reason": "While you have 10 days of history, your completion rate dropped from 80% to 55% in the last 5 days. Let's wait for 3-4 more consistent days at 75%+ completion before stepping up.",
  "motivationalMessage": "You're building a great foundation! Focus on consistency at 30 pages, and we'll revisit stepping up once you're back to your strong performance.",
  "confidence": 85
}
```

## 🎓 Example Scenarios

### Scenario 1: First Step-Up (Ready)
```
Input:
- Days: 7
- Completion: 7/7 (100%)
- Streak: 7 days
- Step-ups: 0
- Goal: 20 pages

AI Analysis:
"Perfect 7-day streak with 100% completion. User is 
comfortable at 20 pages. First step-up should be 
conservative. Suggest 23 pages (15% increase)."

Output:
{
  "shouldStepUp": true,
  "newGoal": 23,
  "reason": "You've completed all 7 days perfectly...",
  "confidence": 88
}
```

### Scenario 2: First Step-Up (Too Early)
```
Input:
- Days: 3
- Completion: 3/3 (100%)
- Streak: 3 days
- Step-ups: 0
- Goal: 20 pages

AI Analysis:
"Only 3 days of data. While perfect, this is too 
early to establish a reliable pattern. Need at 
least 5-7 days before first step-up."

Output:
{
  "shouldStepUp": false,
  "reason": "You're off to a perfect start with 3/3 days...",
  "confidence": 90
}
```

### Scenario 3: Multiple Step-Ups (Ready)
```
Input:
- Days: 25
- Completion: 23/25 (92%)
- Streak: 8 days
- Step-ups: 2 (20→25, 25→30)
- Goal: 30 pages

AI Analysis:
"Two successful step-ups with 92% completion. 
Current 8-day streak shows strong momentum. 
Ready for third step-up. Suggest 36 pages (20%)."

Output:
{
  "shouldStepUp": true,
  "newGoal": 36,
  "reason": "You've successfully completed 2 step-ups...",
  "confidence": 94
}
```

### Scenario 4: Declining Performance (Wait)
```
Input:
- Days: 15
- Completion: 10/15 (67%)
- Recent: 2/5 (40% last 5 days)
- Streak: 0 (just broke)
- Step-ups: 1 (20→25)
- Goal: 25 pages

AI Analysis:
"Completion dropped from 80% to 40% recently. 
Streak just broke. Previous step-up may have 
been too much. Need to stabilize first."

Output:
{
  "shouldStepUp": false,
  "reason": "Your completion rate dropped from 80% to 40%...",
  "confidence": 92
}
```

- Prefers 5-7 days for first step-up
- Requires stable patterns
- Considers recent trends heavily

### Psychological Protection
- Considers user's emotional state
- Evaluates confidence impact
- Prevents burnout scenarios
- Maintains motivation

### Explicit Boundaries
- Never exceeds 25% increase
- Always rounds to whole numbers
- Respects 3-day cooldown
- Follows progression guidelines

---

## 📊 Quality Assurance

### Response Validation
```typescript
// AI response must include:
✓ shouldStepUp (boolean)
✓ newGoal (if true, whole number)
✓ reason (2-3 sentences minimum)
✓ motivationalMessage (1-2 sentences)
✓ confidence (70-100)

// Validation checks:
✓ newGoal > currentGoal
✓ newGoal <= currentGoal * 1.25
✓ confidence >= 70
✓ reason mentions specific data
✓ motivation mentions user goals
```

### Error Handling
```typescript
// If AI response invalid:
1. Log error details
2. Retry with same prompt
3. If still fails, return safe default
4. Never show broken suggestion to user
```
