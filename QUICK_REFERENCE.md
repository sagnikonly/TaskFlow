## 🧠 How AI Decides

### Data AI Receives
```
✓ All completion history (every single day)
✓ All previous step-ups (with dates)
✓ User profile (exam, goals, name)
✓ Task notes and category
✓ Streaks and patterns
```

### AI Considers
```
✓ Are they consistent?
✓ Is performance improving or declining?
✓ Were previous step-ups successful?
✓ Is NOW the right time?
✓ What's the optimal increase?
```

### AI Returns
```json
{
  "shouldStepUp": true/false,
  "newGoal": 35,
  "reason": "Detailed explanation",
  "motivationalMessage": "Encouragement",
  "confidence": 92
}
```

## 🔍 Debugging

### Check Logs
```bash
# View function logs
supabase functions logs analyze-step-up

# Look for:
- "Rate limit hit" → Fallback working
- "Retrying in Xms" → Retry working
- "Error with model" → Check API key
```

### Test Manually
```bash
curl -X POST https://your-project.supabase.co/functions/v1/analyze-step-up \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "task": {
